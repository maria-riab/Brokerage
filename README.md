# Brokerage
As part of the final leg of the program we needed to work on a project of our choosing as a team of 4-6 people for a period of less than 2 months. 

We decided to create an online brokerage, inspired by the likes of Questrade and WealthSimple Trade where users can "buy" and "sell" stocks with real-time prices.

1. Users can add or withdraw "money" and manage their personal information. 

2. Once users are logged in they are redirected to their portfolio where they can see an overview of the stocks that are currently in their account, including any gains or losses since purchasing per stock, overall account value, and other relevant information.

3. They can head over to the trading page, where they can input a ticker symbol and see all information about that company, including current price. There they can also buy and sell that stock. 

We used IEXCloud's API to get our stock information.
Php as our back-end of choice. 
WAMP to run our application on for development.
MySQL for our database. 
Javascript + Bootstrap to make pretty and interactive UIs
